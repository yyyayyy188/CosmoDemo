cosmo-app/src/app/page use cosmo-kit to create a wallet , something incompatible with material-ui happended
and the useBalance hook is not working as expected , it is not the same as examples in cca/example/telescope

cosmo-app/src/app/connect/page use telescope/original web3 api to connect wallet , send tokens , get balance , get proposals and it works as expected.

I am focuing on comprehensive testing of the telescope project.
